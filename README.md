Overview
This project is a Java to Python code converter tool that allows users to translate Java code into equivalent Python code. The tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy input of Java code and displays the converted Python code. It simplifies the process of converting Java applications to Python, enabling interoperability between the two languages.

Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.
Converts Java code to Python code.
Supports basic syntax conversion and indentation handling.
Provides real-time conversion feedback.

Usage:
Input Java Code: Paste or input your Java code into the text area provided in the GUI.
Convert: Click the "Convert" button to initiate the conversion process.
View Python Code: The converted Python code will be displayed in a separate text area.
Save: Optionally, save the converted Python code to a file for further use.

Dependencies:
Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
JavaParser library for parsing Java code (if applicable).
Standard Java libraries for file operations and GUI components.

How to Run:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the Java code using a Java IDE or command-line tools.
Ensure that all necessary dependencies are included in the project.
Open the GUI interface and follow the on-screen instructions to convert Java code to Python.

Disclaimer
This tool provides a basic conversion of Java code to Python and may not cover all edge cases or complex scenarios. It is recommended to review and test the converted code thoroughly.
